This plugin integrates the via (&#x1525;) and hat tip (&#x21ac;) attribution functions of the Curator's Code into the Wordpress editor dashboard.



== Description ==

The Curator's Code Plugin integrates the via (&#x1525;) and hat tip (&#x21ac;) attribution functions of the [Curator's Code](http://www.curatorscode.org/?utm_source=wordpress-plugin&utm_medium=wp-plugin-referral&utm_content=cc-plugin-readme&utm_campaign=curators-code-wp-plugin) into the Wordpress editor dashboard. After installation, click the &#x1525; and &#x21ac; icons to insert a via or hat tip attribution.



The unicode symbols &#x1525; and &#x21ac; are simply shorthand for the familiar "via" and "HT," respectively. While you may still choose to use "via" and "HT" the old-fashioned way – the goal here is to attribute ethically, regardless of how you do it – there are two reasons we are proposing the unicode characters: One, they are a cleaner, more standardized way to attribute. Two, since the characters are wrapped in a hotlink to the Curator's Code site, they serve as messengers for the ethos of the code itself, as people encounter them across the web and click to find out what they represent.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==



**FAQ About the Curator's Code Wordpress Plugin**



= The unicode symbols aren't rendering properly on my Wordpress blog. What can I do? =



Some Wordpress blogs don't automatically support the use of unicode symbols. We have provided a white or black image option, so that you can display an image instead of a unicode character.



A second option is to change the character set in your wp-config.php file. Instructions can be found [here](http://hansengel.wordpress.com/2007/10/09/wordpress-unicode-and-s/). We claim no responsibility if you choose to implement this process, and provide no support/warranties/etc.



**FAQ About the Curator's Code Itself**



= Do I have to use the unicode characters? What's wrong with the old-fashioned way? =



These characters are just a proposed way of standardizing attribution, and they help spread the broader message of The Curator's Code – but they're not the only way. If you're having technical difficulties, or are confused by them, or just plain don't like them, you can and should just use the standard "via" and "HT" options for direct and indirect attribution of discovery, respectively. The goal here is not to mandate how to attribute, but to encourage to attribute.



= What's the difference between the two symbols, or "via" and "HT," and why does it matter? =



Part of what The Curator’s Code aspires to do is evolve our thinking about the levels of attribution. 



**“Via” (&#x1525;)** tends to denote a direct repost — something you found elsewhere and shared with your audience with little modification or elaboration. 



**“HT” or "Hat Tip" (&#x21ac;)** tends to stand for indirect discovery — something for which you got the idea at your source, but modified or elaborated on significantly when sharing with your audience.



== Screenshots ==



1. Clicking on the &#x1525; or &#x21ac; buttons will load a pop-up with two fields - one for the URL, and the second field for the anchor text of the attribution link.
2. On the settings page you can choose if you want to use the unicode symbols or plain text. Additionally, you can choose if you want the symbol/text to link back to curatorscode.org or not.
